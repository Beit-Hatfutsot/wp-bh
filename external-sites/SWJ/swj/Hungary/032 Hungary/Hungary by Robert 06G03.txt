the legions that were expanding the Roman Empire northward in the third century
C.E. Hungarian Jews proceeded to found 38 communities in the medieval period,
the most important being Buda and Sopron. Conditions were favorable for the
Jews during Turkish rule (1526-1686), but worsened under the Hapsburgs as urban
commercial conflict developed into an ingrained hatred. Impelled to move, the
Jews were welcomed on the estates of Hungarian nobles such as Counts Esterh</span><span

of 1867 established a quasi-independent state within the renamed
Austro-Hungarian Empire. The new Hungarian Parliament soon enacted Jewish
emancipation, removing remaining judicial and economic restrictions, allowing
Jews to engage in all professions and to settle in all localities. No longer
limited to the towns and villages, the Jews&#8212;now counting more than 500,000
persons across the country&#8212;began to stream into the main cities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>The Emancipation period (1867&#8211;1914) brought
Hungarian Jewry to a crest in political, economic, and cultural spheres. Their
political position was strengthened in 1895 with the official recognition of
Judaism as an equally accepted religion. By 1910 Jews were 5 percent of the
population (numbering over 900,000), but comprised about half of the
journalists, lawyers and doctors, and nearly 60 percent of the country&#8217;s
merchants. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Political emancipation opened the door to higher
secular education and adaptation to the outside world. Such radical options
engaged Hungarian Jewry in a bitter culture conflict. The Neolog movement
favored modifications of the religious ritual as well as cultural and political
integration; the Orthodox opposed these adaptations. The conflict came to a
head at the government-summoned General Jewish Congress of 1868 and
precipitated a major ideological split that plagued the life of Hungarian Jewry
until the Holocaust overtook all sides.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Integration and assimilation made deep inroads into
the Jewish community. Hungarian Jewry became one of the most assimilated Jewish
communities in Europe, with a growing tendency towards apostasy&#8212;especially
among the upper classes. In contrast, Hasidism swelled in the northeast, in the
Szatmar, Bereg (including Munkacs), and Marmaros districts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the battles of World War I did not prevent overt anti-Semitic riots, known as
the &#8220;White Terror,&#8221; in the post-war years. This anti-Semitism was fully
manifested in World War II: Nazi troops marched into Hungary in &quot;Operation
Margaret&quot; on March 19, 1944. Ghetto-ization and deportation followed with
demonic efficiency. Toiling relentlessly before the advancing Soviet troops,
the Nazis managed to murder more than half a million Hungarian Jews by war's
end. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
