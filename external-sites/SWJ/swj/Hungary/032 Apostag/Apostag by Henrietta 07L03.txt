text-indent:36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:
Verdana'>Apostag, on the east side of the Danube some fifty miles south of
Budapest and a current population of 2,660, still consists of one story houses
among small farms and gardens on narrow streets. It is so inconsequential that
it appears only on comprehensive maps.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:
Verdana'>The <i>kehillah</i> of Apostag was one of the hundreds of village
communities scattered throughout central Europe. The shaded cemetery bordering
the synagogue courtyard contains gravestones from the beginning of the 17<sup>th</sup>
century, which suggests that Jews may have lived there as early as 1630, the
middle of the Turkish occupation. The land was under populated after the wars
and 18<sup>th</sup> century nobles and landowners attracted immigrants to
resettle the area. Jews from Austria, Bohemia and Moravia were among others who
responded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:
Verdana'>The <i>kehillah,</i> at about 600 persons and a fifth of Apostag&#8217;s
population, assumed responsibility as the religious center for Jews of still
smaller villages in the region. Their first synagogue, built in 1768, burned in
1820. It was replaced by the present one, in the transitional Classical,
so-called <i>Zopf</i> style in 1821 on the same site and incorporated the
unchanged masonry structure of the earlier building. In 1840, the kehillah
numbered 783 people, but it dwindled to half within 40 years, as many were
attracted to the metropolitan centers when it became permissible to live there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:
Verdana'>The first of Apostag&#8217;s rabbis from 1768 to 1818 was Rabbi Josef Moshe
who set up the <i>hevra kadishah</i> and founded a yeshiva. The congregants
loved his successor, Rabbi Basch, who opened a Jewish school in 1823. The <i>kehillah</i>
opted for Neolog affiliation in 1878. The school functioned until the turn of
the century, when it closed its doors as parental interest in a specifically
Jewish education for the children dwindled. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There was hardly any Zionist
fervor. The Jews tended to assimilation and integration into Hungarian society
and some of them attained high government positions. They served in the
Hungarian army in World War I, but that did not protect their shops from
looting by demobilized soldiers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:
Verdana'>With no Jews remaining in Apostag after World War II, the community
was officially disbanded in 1947 and the synagogue was transferred to the
Organization of Hungarian Jews. Bought by the Apostag town council, the
synagogue became a storage depot for agricultural products and fertilizer. By
the mid 1980&#8217;s, it was on the agenda for demolition, but a perceptive village
teacher who recognized the admirable architectural and artistic features of the
synagogue fought tenaciously for restoration until he had council approval.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Starting with village funds, the
project won grants from regional, national and Jewish sources. Local people
volunteered to work on construction and landscaping. The restoration was completed
in less than two years and a festive dedication was held in October 1987. The
building now contains a concert hall serving also as a wedding chapel, a small
Jewish museum, an elegant library in the gallery and an exhibition that honors
native son, the writer Lajos Nagy, in the entrance lobby. The Europa Nostra
Federation, founded in 1963 to encourage preservation and restoration of
historic sites in Europe, awarded a silver medal for the restoration of the
Apostag synagogue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:
Verdana'>The Nazi transports of Operation Margaret in 1944, wrenched a hundred
Jews away from Apostag. Only three of them returned after the war, but none
remained. One of them was Chana Wittberg who came to live in Israel. She
recounts her life in prewar Apostag, where she was one of few Jewish children.
The Jews maintained cordial relations with their Christian neighbors; before
Pesah, Chana&#8217;s mother used to send her to bring samples of matzah for the
neighbors to taste. There were no Orthodox families in the village and no
rabbi, but all the Jews went to the synagogue on the holidays and retained some
aspects of Jewish life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:
Verdana'>Everything changed after 1942 when Jews no longer had business permits
and the Jewish children were chased out of school. Soon after, the Jews were
packed into cattle cars and sent to Auschwitz. After the war, Chana returned
and found nobody from her family and only two others of the community. She
walked the empty streets dazed, found houses ransacked and the synagogue in
shambles, with the floor ripped up because the goyim had searched for
valuables. The next day Chana ran away from Apostag.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
