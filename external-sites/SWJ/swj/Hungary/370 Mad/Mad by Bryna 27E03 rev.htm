northeast Hungary, just 23 kilometers from Miskolc. Famous for its wine
production, the area has attracted Jews since the time of the Middle-Ages, when
they would come for the grape-harvesting season. By the early-eighteenth
century there were a few who had received permission to settle in M d, and most
of them became involved in the wine business, either through production or
sales. Their Hegyalja wine soon earned a good reputation, and was known
throughout Hungary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
success in the wine industry also earned the Jews enemies among their
non-Jewish neighbors. In 1812, with 76 Jewish families already living in M</span> <span
style='font-family:Verdana'>d, the local Christians sent an official complaint
against them. The committee that investigated the matter recommended that all
Jews who settled in M d after 1790 be banished. This committee also recommended
that the complainants file a suit against Jews practicing usury and that they
should compel Jewish owners of vineyard to sell their property to Christians.
Most of these recommendations were not carried out, yet the friction between
the two communities remained. Again in 1828 there was a request to the town&#8217;s
authorities to banish all Jews from M d.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
this anti-Semitism, the Jewish community in M d flourished. The city had one of
the most important Orthodox communities in Hungary, and was known even outside
the country for its yeshiva. This fame was due to the many respected scholar-rabbis
who made M d their home. Among them were Rabbi Natan Feitel Reinitz, author of <i>Divrei
Ranaf</i>; Rabbi Amnon Blum, author of <i>Responsa </i>and <i>Beit Sh&#8217;arim</i>;
and Rabbi Mordecai Winkler, whose <i>Responsa </i>was later published as <i>Levushay
Mordecai</i>. The yeshiva played such an important part in the lives of the
Jews that they closed the government school in favor of the <i>heder</i>. They
opened it again in 1813 only after coercion from the local authorities. This&#8212;as
well as the 200 yeshiva students and the 50 Torah scrolls in M d before World
War II&#8212;testify to the level of religious learning that once existed there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
testy relationship between Jews and Christians deteriorated further in 1938,
when the Discrimination Laws were published. In 1941 10-15 families who could not
prove Hungarian citizenship were transferred to Kamenecz-Podolsk, where they
died. The year after that, Jewish youth were seized for forced labor and sent
to the Ukraine; only ten of the young people survived. Finally, after the
German occupation began in 1944, the remaining Jews of M d were transferred to
the district capital, Satoraljaujhely, and from there to Auschwitz. Of the few
Jews who survived the Holocaust, only 28 returned to M d. Today there are no
Jews left in the town. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

synagogue, however, was declared a historic monument in 1946 and remains there
to this day. Built in 1798, it is a beautiful, Baroque-style shul. By legend,
each stone used in its construction was individually carried by a member of the
community, so that no strange hands would touch the material of the sacred
building. Now that that community is gone, the only ones left to care for the
shul are gentiles. It is currently being restored under the supervision of the
Herman Otto Museum of Miskolc. There may not be many people left to attest to
the authenticity of this restoration, but each year a group of<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>eleven Holocaust survivors, born in
M d, reassemble there from the far corners of the world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
