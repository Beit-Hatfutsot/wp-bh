<h1><b><span style='font-size:28.0pt;color:#993366'>The Butchers and the
Tanners<o:p></o:p></span></b></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span
style='font-size:28.0pt;font-family:"Monotype Corsiva";color:#993366'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>In
the mid-18<sup>th</sup> century, Count Ferenc Esterhazy built a castle at Papa,
a town located in the Bakony Hills of western Hungary and invited Jews to
settle in the town. For the next two centuries, his plan worked well and the
arrangement was beneficial to both parties. Today, however, the Esterhazy
castle is no longer a home, but a museum, and the Papa synagogue---once the
pride of the city&#8217;s 3,500 Jews---is vandalized, forlorn and locked. No longer
in the possession of the few Jews left in Papa, the grand synagogue stands at
Petofi Sandor Street, in the heart of what was once the Jewish quarter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The
town chronicles detail the gradual establishment of a vibrant and traditional
Jewish community. The first record of a Jewish family appears in 1698. Fifty
years later, the Count permitted the establishment of a formal <i>kehillah</i>
in the market area. The 15 families who lived in town were allowed to build a
synagogue, set up an <i>eruv </i>(symbolic fence) and provide kosher meat and
wine. It was a quiet time and the community prospered. In the early 19<sup>th</sup>
century, they opened a ceramics factory, well known for its distinctive
Hungarian-style products. Although Jews owned textile, paper and brick
factories and a steam production plant, there were numerous tailors among them
and over 100 families of tanners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>By
1840, the Jewish community was 20 percent of the town population and their
officials served the needs of the <i>kehillah</i> well. They managed a 25-acre
plot of land that they would sell off periodically to finance their charitable
institutions. There were social organizations for the needy, for Talmud
students and for new mothers. In 1818, they established one of the first Jewish
schools in Hungary. It later became more secular, included Hungarian subjects
and began to enroll girls in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The
tension between the Neolog and Orthodox movements did not prevent the building
of the Papa synagogue between 1844-1846, although there was some controversy
when the reformist rabbi, Leopold Loew, gave his dedication in Hungarian rather
than Yiddish. The Esterhazy family was still in favor of the Jewish community
and supported their expansions. The <i>kehillah</i> maintained the synagogue,
hospital, high school, an outstanding rabbinical college and several community
offices. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The
blood libel plagued the Jews of Hungary in mid-19<sup>th</sup> century. When a
girl from the village of Tiszaeszlar in northeast Hungary disappeared, church
officials accused some Jews of murdering the girl to use her blood in Passover
rituals. Karoly Eotovos, author and politician, exposed the lies and defended
the accused. The defendants were acquitted, yet the anti-Jewish sentiment
continued and there were attacks against Jews throughout Hungary. When the
riots reached Papa&#8217;s Jewish quarter, husky butchers and tanners repulsed the
mob by brandishing their tools of trade.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Papa&#8217;s
Jews were active Zionists who promoted <i>aliyah </i>(going up) to Palestine.
In 1862, a plucky midwife from Papa left for Jerusalem on her own, because she
had learned that there was no Jewish midwife in the city. In 1904, the Zionist
organization, <i>Hovevei Zion</i>, began a branch in the city. In Papa, even
the Orthodox Jews advocated Zionism at an early stage: in the 1920s, Rabbi
Aryeh Roth published an article, which defended Zionism from an Orthodox
viewpoint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>At
the start of World War II, Papa became a center for gathering forced labor
before the conscripts were shipped to work camps. Papa&#8217;s Jewish community
leaders were sent to camps in 1940, and in 1944, the Jews were forced into a
ghetto. On July 4 and 5 of 1944, 2,565 Jews of Papa and 300 more from the
vicinity were forced into cattle cars bound for Auschwitz. After the
deportation, the Germans stabled horses in the synagogue. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>When
the war ended 500 Jews returned. Though they tried to revive Jewish life in the
town, the 1956 revolution turned many of them into voluntary exiles. By 1972,
the community had shrunken to 50 people, and in 1989, only a handful remained.
For a while, a few Jews and Fidesz, an organization dedicated to the protection
of minorities, took care of the synagogue. Fidesz had plans to restore the
building for a cultural center, but these were not realized.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
