style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>In
Vienna, Krems, and Wiener Neustadt, small Jewish communities appeared in the
twelfth century, sustained primarily by money lending under letters of
privilege by Count Friedrich II.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, &#8220;Jewish usury&#8221; was a constant theme of hate-sermons by
the clergy and the cause of physical attacks. The nobility pressured Maximilian
I until he consented to the mass expulsion of Jews in 1496 from the provinces
of Styria and Carinthia in southern Austria. The banished Jews were allowed to settle
in the east, in what is now Burgenland and western Hungary. The obligatory
yellow clothing badge was introduced in 1551. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>By the
seventeenth century, the Vienna Jewish community had become prosperous and
influential, with many of its leaders members of the court. Among the most
famous were Samuel Oppenheimer and Samson Wertheimer, scholars and observant
Jews who gained fame as court agents. The 40-year reign (1740&#8211;1780) of Maria
Theresa was a period of severe oppression for the Jews. The ascent of Joseph II
to the throne, however, and his 1781 Tolerance Edict, eased the Jewish
condition in the Austrian Empire to some degree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Viennese
Jewish families patronized the arts and sciences, sponsored musicians and
founded hospitals and orphanages that benefited both Jewish and Christian
needy. The first major synagogue in Vienna, on Seitenstettengasse, opened in
1826. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>The
revolution of 1848 gave the Jews hope for equal rights and full participation
in society, a dream that they realized in 1867. Although anti-Semitism
increased during the mid-nineteenth century, expanded job opportunities
encouraged Jewish immigration from neighboring lands, especially from Bohemia
and the provinces of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>After
the First World War, the Zionists founded a Jewish National Council to fight
against assimilation and anti-Semitism. Politically active, Jews were among the
leadership of the Social Democratic Party in the inter-war period, the only
party that had no anti-Semitic planks in its party platform. As Jewish numbers
in Vienna before the Second World War rose to 165,946, however, the capital
became a hotbed of anti-Semitic activity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Austrian gentiles welcomed the <i>Anschluss</i> (annexation by Germany) of
March 13, 1938.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The riots of <i>Kristallnacht</i>
occurred on November 9&#8211;10 of that year. Some 100 synagogues in Austria were
destroyed, then or during World War II.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nearly 70,000 Jews lost their lives in concentration camps or by
suicide.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the war&#8217;s end, nearly 30,000 &#8220;displaced persons&#8221; returned or arrived from
camps. The Austrian Jews re-established the Vienna community as well as smaller
ones in Baden, Bad Gasten, Graz, Linz, Salzburg, and Innsbruck. In addition to

steady decline in the Jewish population was reversed in the early 1990s as
waves of Soviet Jews passed through the renascent Austrian Jewish
community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>More than 1,000 Soviet
Jews settled and swelled the Jewish ranks in Vienna, but nearly as many
continued on to Israel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The newly
arrived Jews established schools, community centers, and vocational programs.
