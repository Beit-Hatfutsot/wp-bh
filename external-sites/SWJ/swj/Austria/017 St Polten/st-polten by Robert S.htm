<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>The first mention of Jews in St. P”lten is from the
14th century, when St. P”lten Jews loaned money to Vienna citizens Nikolaus
Holinus and Johann Hierz. Frenzied riots against the Jews were common, and in
1628, the Jews were ultimately expelled. They were not allowed back into St.
P”lten until the nineteenth century. By 1857, a community of 252 Jews in St.
P”lten had achieved approval, hired a teacher of religion, established a
cemetery, and formally organized a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>kehillah</i>.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>In 1888 the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>kehillah
</i>embarked on the winding path that would eventually lead to construction of
a satisfactory synagogue. Attempts to buy property continued until 1911, when
an agreement was made to build the new synagogue at the corner of Schul
Promenade and Lederergasse. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>In the plan, the community called for 220 seats for
men and 150 for women at a proposed cost of 95,000 crowns. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Kehillot</i> in Austria were prosperous at the time and synagogue
architects were busy, but Theodor Schreier tendered a proposal that was
adopted. The building committee strove for the best possible workmanship within
its budget, employing prominent craftsmen to make the benches, windows, and the
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bimah</i>. The total construction cost
came to 141,240 crowns, about a third higher than the estimate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>After twenty-four years in the preparation &#8211;
funding, site selection and bureaucratic approval, site purchase, architectural
contest, and final plan &#8211; the structure went up in 14 months. The dedication
was fixed for August 17, 1913, eve of the emperor&#8217;s birthday. Patriots all, St.
P”lten Jews affixed a plaque in his honor. Prominent dignitaries attended the
dedication, and the event had extensive press coverage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>St. P”lten Jews assembled peacefully and prayed in
their synagogue for 24 years &#8211; as many years as it had taken to create it. Then
came the terror of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>kristalnacht</i>.
About 400 people, some in Nazi uniform, descended on the synagogue. They
battered down the doors, burst into the sanctuary, smashed the windows, broke
the great candelabra, and chopped the furniture. They threw religious books and
ritual objects into a bonfire and bellowed Nazi political songs while the books
burned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>The synagogue was left to deteriorate after the
war. In 1979, however, the Federal Memorials Institute declared the building to
be &#8220;the most significant Jewish religious structure in lower Austria,&#8221; and
initiated efforts to save it. The complex was opened in 1984 for new
educational and cultural functions as the Institut fur Geschichte der Juden in
Osterreich (Institute for the History of Austrian Jewry). The institute&#8217;s main
goal is to research the history of the Jews in Austria, to emphasize their
contribution to Austrian philosophy and culture, and to use this knowledge in
the struggle against anti-Semitism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>Martha Keil of the institute sent us an unexpected
little treasure in 1995. It is an invitation to the synagogue consecration,
addressed to the right honorable Sir Bernhard Osterreicher. The detailed
three-page program inspires the following imagined scene on that bright Sunday
afternoon: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:72.0pt'>The gallery ladies in elegant lace and
chiffon look down on a sea of men&#8217;s cylinder hats below as the assembly rises
for the solemn procession and entrance of the Torah scrolls. All chant &#8220;Ma
Tovu,&#8221; &#8220;How fair are your tents, O Jacob, your dwellings, O Israel!&#8221; (Num.
24:5.) The Rabbi of the Jewish community of Vienna kindles the eternal light
for the first time and closes the Holy Ark while the choir chants, &#8220;Etz chaim
hi&#8221; (&#8220;For the Torah is a tree of life&#8221;; Prov 3:18) The ceremony ends as the
congregation and all their distinguished guests rise for the Austrian imperial
anthem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>How reassuring it must have been for the loyal
Austrian Jews in St. P”lten to have faith in their country on that great
festive day. Of about 650 Jews living in St. P”lten before the Second World
War, 214 were murdered by the Nazis. A memorial erected in front of the
synagogue in 1992 caries their names, engraved in stone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
