Eisenstadt <i>Judenrichter</i>, administrative head of the <i>kehillah</i>, was
a lofty personage. It was customary in public for a clerk to precede him
carrying the wooden mace of office, carved with a crown on top. This <i>kehillah</i>
kept its political autonomy until 1938, longer than any other in Europe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

established a new ghetto on his estate in 1675, later known as Unterberg
Eisenstadt and affectionately called &#8220;Little Jerusalem.&#8221; A charter of 1690
granted Jews autonomy in return for annual taxes and occasional gifts,
including 30 pounds of pepper, annually. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the most distinguished Jews in Eisenstadt&#8217;s history is the many-faceted Samson
Wertheimer (1658-1724). At the Viennese court he was <i>Hofoberfaktor,</i>
chief administrator, of the financial affairs of emperors Leopold I, Joseph I,
and Charles VI from 1694 to 1709. He was equally useful to the Esterh</span><span

community synagogue, mikveh<i> </i>(ritual bath), school, and provision for
school teachers. Prince Paul Esterh</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

mansion in 1696 in recognition of 20 years of devoted services to the family&#8217;s
financial affairs. Wertheimer refurbished the mansion and installed a private
synagogue, known as the Wertheimer Schul.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

1795, a severe conflagration destroyed the Eisenstadt ghetto. Synagogue
reconstruction waited until 1832, when the community numbered 908 persons.
Great festivity accompanied the cornerstone laying on August 6, 1832. Flowers
hung from the trees and 24 frolicking children in holiday dress added color and
pageantry. At the inauguration, two years later, members contributed ceremonial
silver, a painted glass beaker for the <i>hevrah kadishah,</i> Torah scrolls,
an elaborate <i>parokhet</i> and a parchment megillah executed by the talented
scribe, Elie Gabriel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lay in fertile wine country. A grandson of <i>kehillah</i>-founder Benjamin
Wolf Austerlitz, named Chaim Joachim Wolf ben Meir Kittsee, pioneered the sale
of Eisenstadt&#8217;s kosher wine to non-wine-producing areas. Taking Wolf as his
surname, he settled down to business in 1784. The Wolf wine business became the
most important one of its kind in the Austrian empire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Wolf&#8217;s
son Leopold and grandsons Adolf and Ignaz expanded the business. In 1875, they
bought the Wertheimer mansion, converted the lower floors to house the central
offices of the wholesale wine business and hung a sign on the front, <i>Weingrosshandlung

(Leopold Wolf&#8217;s Sons, Wholesale Wines). Sandor Wolf, who succeeded his father
Ignaz at the helm, was an ardent collector of art and Judaica. In 40 years, he
amassed a 26,000-item collection, displayed in the family home, as the Wolf
Museum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

War II destroyed the community. The Nazis immediately decreed the expulsion of
Jews from Burgenland, ending the 250-year autonomy of the Eisenstadt <i>kehillah</i>.
By October 1938, there were no Jews left in Eisenstadt. On November 9, an
unrestrained mob devastated the community synagogue. In their haste to destroy,
they overlooked the little Wertheimer Schul, hidden above the offices of the
Wolf wine company, one of the few synagogues in Austria and Germany that
totally escaped damage at that time. Of the 441 Eisenstadt Jews, 245 survived
the war. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>In
1982, the old Wertheimer-Wolf mansion was rededicated as the Austrian Jewish
Museum, which includes much of Sandor Wolf&#8217;s Judaica. The museum&#8217;s main
attraction is the restored Wertheimer Schul, still a sanctified synagogue
available to serve visiting worshippers. In its catalogue, the Austrian Jewish
Museum declares its mission to fight against the ignorance that breeds
prejudice. Using phrases attributed to Hananiah ben Teradyon, martyred in the
Bar Kokhbah uprising of 135 C.E. (Talmud, Avoda Zara, 18A), it concludes, &#8220;Only
the parchments burn, the letters fly away.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
