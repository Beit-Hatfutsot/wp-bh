annexed Trieste in 1382 and didn’t relinquish it to Italy until after World War
I, but the city remained culturally Italian all along. Jews may have lived in
Trieste as early as the 11<sup>th</sup> century and certainly from the 14<sup>th</sup>,
although the <i>kehillah</i> was not formally organized until 1746. In the
interest of maximal development of the port, the monarchy was lax in Trieste of
its customary Jewish repression because Jews were presumed to promote the
port’s trade and growth potential. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

synagogue and legal recognition, the small Ashkenazic Jewish community held
services in a private home from the 15<sup>th</sup> century. When Vienna
decreed a ghetto in 1693, the 60 Jews in a city of 3,000 bravely protested the
ghetto location and held out until 1696 when they reluctantly gave up the
struggle under heavy pressure and moved to the assigned ghetto houses.
Wealthier Jews spilled out of the ghetto even before it was abolished by decree
in 1764. After the ghetto gates came down in 1785, the Jewish population spread
throughout the city and grew rapidly to 2,000 in 1811</span><span dir=RTL></span><span

of Jewish Trieste's most illustrious sons, Rabbi Professor Samuel David
Luzzatto, (1800-1865) known as the Shadal, was a philosopher, poet, Bible
scholar and translator. He directed the newly established rabbinical seminary,
Collegio Rabbinico in Padua. His scholarship combined the deep erudition of the
medieval rabbis with the newer trends in Judaic scholarship emanating from the
enlightened Haskalah circles of northern Europe. He was a master of Hebrew
philology and translated the Bible into Italian. His literary circle included
Hebrew poets, such as his cousin Rachel Morpurgo—whose sonnets, elegies and
wedding poems in the style of the Spanish Hebrew religious poets and the
Italian Renaissance related mostly to family and biographical incidents</span><span

some chose to convert. Italian Fascists desecrated the synagogue in 1942. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Americas in the last part of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. With the approach

leaving Europe for Israel. Two ships operated on the Trieste-Haifa route. The
Jewish captain, Umberto Steindler of the <i>Gerusalemme</i> boasted over one
hundred trips to Palestine between the world wars. After being turned back to
