foot of the Regale Mountain in the Piedmont hills of northwestern Italy. Jews
first settled in Mondovi in 1580, after expulsions from Spain and southern
France. </p>

EN-US'>Jewish moneylenders were vital to the local economy, charging far less
interest than the clerical loan banks. Their useful business positions and
Mondovi&#8217;s distance from Rome favored cordial relations with the Christian
community. A 1555 papal decree confined Jews to ghettos, but the ruling Italian
Savoy dukes avoided complying. Finally, in 1720, an &#8220;open&#8221; ghetto was
established in the upper town on via Vico behind the church. As this was a
major thoroughfare, no gate was built to close it off. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

EN-US'>Continuing this lax interpretation of papal decrees, Christians lived
near the Jews and, oddly, Jews lived in proximity to the church. After the
Edict of Emancipation on April 2,1848, Fortuna Estella Levi organized Jewish
and Catholic women jointly to donate clothing and goods to families of
Piedmont&#8217;s soldiers fighting for Italian independence. The harmonious
relationship obtained as long as Jews lived in Mondovi. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-fareast-language:
EN-US'>The community was always tiny. A census by Carlo Emanuele III in 1761
listed 64 individuals in 12 Mondovi Jewish families. In 1839, 79 males and 68
females were counted, although this included <i>kehillah</i> participants from
valley villages below<i>. </i>In 1869 the population had risen to 200. The <i>kehillah</i>
of Turin annexed that of Mondovi and others in 1931. Family names associated
with the town include: Levi, Momigliano, Lattes, Ottolenghi, Iona, Foa, Segre
and Ortona. Town documents revealed women&#8217;s personal names such as: Giuditta,
Graziosa, Clelia, Diamanta, Sara, Vittoria, Rachele, Ester and Bona. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Turin and six from Mondovi. One of these, Dr. Marco Levi (1910 - 2000) was the
last Jew who lived in Mondovi. His forebear,<b> </b>Donato Levi had founded the
Mondovi Bank of Exchange and Discount in 1820 and the bank remained in family
hands down to Marco, until a merger in 1972. Other Jewish businesses included:
raising silkworms, manufacturing and selling silk; a ceramics industry; and an
iron foundry established by engineer Giorgio Bassani that supplied the Italian
Air Force in WW I. Felice Momigliano (1886 - 1924), an author and politician,
bequeathed his extensive book collection to Mondovi&#8217;s municipal library.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

families remained. Never electrified, the synagogue was opened briefly for a
wedding in 1924. In 1980, Jewish youths from Turin assisted Israeli architect
David Cassuto in cleaning and refurbishing the synagogue. A <i>ketubbah</i>
(marriage contract) from 1750, pages of micrography and embossed Torah crowns
in 17<sup>th</sup> century Baroque style were found in the benches of the
sanctuary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

third floor of an apartment building at 65 via Vico. It&#8217;s decorative style is
unique to Piedmont synagogues and survives today only in Chieri, Carmangnola
and Cherasco, as well as Mondovi. In the center of the main room an octagonal <i>tevah
</i>(reader&#8217;s desk)<i> </i>is raised two steps above floor level. Six wood
panels around the <i>tevah</i> are carved and decorated, leaving one face on
either side open for entry. Eight pillars in trompe l&#8217;oeil<b> </b>marble paint
support an airy wooden baldachin. The same technique created 14 purple-draped
&#8220;windows&#8221; on three walls and two towering Corinthian pillars on the Ark wall.
Biblical verses inscribed on panels above the windows are clues to the
philosophy of Mondovi&#8217;s Jews. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

platform approaching the exceptional walk-in Ark. A large bronze <i>hanukkia</i>
stands next to the Ark on the platform. The Ark doors are carved and gilded
wood, centered between two helical columns painted with a climbing grapevine. A
seven-branched <i>menorah </i>is carved<i> </i>on the upper part of the doors
and its candles bear flames of red paint. The walk-in Ark juts into a rear
porch that served as the <i>heder</i>.<i> </i>A direct hit by Allied bombs on
the Turin synagogue in World War II destroyed the 13 Torah scrolls sent from
Mondovi for safekeeping.</span><span style='font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:
