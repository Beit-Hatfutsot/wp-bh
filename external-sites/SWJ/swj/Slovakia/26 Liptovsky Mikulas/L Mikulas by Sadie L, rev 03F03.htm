<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>In
1720, the first Jews to settle in Liptovsky Svaty Mikulas were peddlers and
merchants from Holesov, Moravia. They lived peacefully with other minorities
and the Protestant majority. And they prospered, exporting skins and wool,
managing distilleries and founding a cheese-processing plant, as well as a
thriving lumber industry. Following the French Revolution, the <i>kehillah</i>
tolerated a broad range of beliefs among the members. Besides supporting the
successful <i>yeshivah,</i> they encouraged secular culture and secular
schools. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>From
1820, liberal community leader, Yaakov Diener and other teachers established
private schools in the Haskalah spirit, with German as the language of
instruction. In addition to Judaic subjects, Jewish pupils studied natural
sciences, geography, general history and the works of writers such as Lessing,
Goethe and Schiller. Prosperous members of the 300 family <i>kehillah</i>
supported a secular school, opened in 1845, with a curriculum that included
gymnastics, singing, swimming and skating. Christian aristocrats sent their
children to the school.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>A
Jewish secondary school was established in 1860 and the illustrious alumni
included the first Jewish lawyer in Hungary, Simon Goldstein, and Samuel
Fischer, who founded the world-renowned publicity house in Berlin that still
carries his name. Because of the high standards of its many secular and
cultural institutions, the Mikulas community earned the epithet “the Jewish
Athens.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>After
the political reconciliation between Austria and Hungary, Jews could vote or be
candidates for election in municipal elections. Two Jewish delegates gained
council seats in 1863. In 1865, Isaac Diener became the first of several Jewish
mayors; others were Jozef Stern, Maric Ring, and Dr. Mano Steiner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>There
was much discussion of religious reform in the liberal <i>kehillah,</i> one of
the first Hungarian communities to split along religious lines. When the
community voted to affiliate with the Neolog (Hungarian Reform) stream, the
Orthodox minority seceded and set up an autonomous community, including a
separate prayer room and school. Despite the official split in 1864, they were
ready by 1875 to overlook their disagreements and, making mutual concessions,
they reunited to worship as one congregation in their new synagogue. The
synagogue was completed in 1845 at the cost of 42,000 forints. Congregants
carried the Torah scrolls through the streets from the old building to the new
one. District nobility and town officials participated in the ceremonies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The
synagogue suffered two fires, one in 1878 and again in 1904, when it was nearly
demolished. The <i>parnassim </i>called on the Jewish architect, Lipot Baumhorn
to plan the rebuilding. Restored, the synagogue became the stateliest structure
in the city, artistically one of the most remarkable in the Hungarian kingdom.
It was rededicated in 1906.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>After
World War I, there was great interest in Zionism, and the large community
building was given for youth activities in this connection. By 1930, the
community numbered more than 1000.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>1,500
Jews were crowded into the city during the early years of World War II. More
than 80% of those who were transported perished. Most of the Jews who returned
soon moved away, and today there are not enough Jews for a <i>minyan</i> in Liptovsky
Mikulas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>In 1980, the synagogue was sold to the
municipality. After the Communist demise, in the early 1990s, public-spirited
citizens formed a committee to save the building. It received the status of a
historical monument and there was a national and international campaign to
raise funds for restoration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>On
July 28, 1991, a special benefit concert was held in the synagogue to support
the restoration of historical monuments in the city, including the synagogue.
Mikulas Jews, local dignitaries and representatives from the central Jewish
community in Bratislava attended. Gentile and Jewish volunteers spent three
days cleaning the building and removing debris. For a stage backdrop over the <i>bimah,</i>
they painted on a long drape the names and birth years of some of the 900
Mikulas Jewish victims of the Shoah and hung it high on the Ark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The
well-attended concert was called Mosty (Bridges), a theme that Deputy Federal
Chairman Jira Dienstbier developed in his opening address:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>“I do not believe
that the bridges between peoples in our country and inside us were destroyed.
The bridges are only damaged. Jewish culture is part of European culture. This
concert and the restoration of this synagogue are the beginning of something
new, something that begins with the building of bridges.”</span></p>
