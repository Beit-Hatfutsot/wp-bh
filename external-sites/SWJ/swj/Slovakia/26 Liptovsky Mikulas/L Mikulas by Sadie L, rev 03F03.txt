<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>In 1720, the first Jews to settle in Liptovsky Svaty
Mikulas were peddlers and merchants from Holesov, Moravia. They lived
peacefully with other minorities and the Protestant majority. And they
prospered, exporting skins and wool, managing distilleries and founding a
cheese-processing plant, as well as a thriving lumber industry. Following the
French Revolution, the <i>kehillah</i> tolerated a broad range of beliefs among
the members. Besides supporting the successful <i>yeshivah,</i> they encouraged
secular culture and secular schools. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>From 1820, liberal community leader, Yaakov Diener
and other teachers established private schools in the Haskalah spirit, with
German as the language of instruction. In addition to Judaic subjects, Jewish
pupils studied natural sciences, geography, general history and the works of writers
such as Lessing, Goethe and Schiller. Prosperous members of the 300 family <i>kehillah</i>
supported a secular school, opened in 1845, with a curriculum that included
gymnastics, singing, swimming and skating. Christian aristocrats sent their
children to the school.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>A Jewish secondary school was established in 1860
and the illustrious alumni included the first Jewish lawyer in Hungary, Simon
Goldstein, and Samuel Fischer, who founded the world-renowned publicity house
in Berlin that still carries his name. Because of the high standards of its
many secular and cultural institutions, the Mikulas community earned the
epithet “the Jewish Athens.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>After the political reconciliation between Austria
and Hungary, Jews could vote or be candidates for election in municipal
elections. Two Jewish delegates gained council seats in 1863. In 1865, Isaac
Diener became the first of several Jewish mayors; others were Jozef Stern,
Maric Ring, and Dr. Mano Steiner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>There was much discussion of religious reform in
the liberal <i>kehillah,</i> one of the first Hungarian communities to split
along religious lines. When the community voted to affiliate with the Neolog
(Hungarian Reform) stream, the Orthodox minority seceded and set up an
autonomous community, including a separate prayer room and school. Despite the
official split in 1864, they were ready by 1875 to overlook their disagreements
and, making mutual concessions, they reunited to worship as one congregation in
their new synagogue. The synagogue was completed in 1845 at the cost of 42,000
forints. Congregants carried the Torah scrolls through the streets from the old
building to the new one. District nobility and town officials participated in
the ceremonies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>The synagogue suffered two fires, one in 1878 and
again in 1904, when it was nearly demolished. The <i>parnassim </i>called on
the Jewish architect, Lipot Baumhorn to plan the rebuilding. Restored, the
synagogue became the stateliest structure in the city, artistically one of the
most remarkable in the Hungarian kingdom. It was rededicated in 1906.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>After World War I, there was great interest in
Zionism, and the large community building was given for youth activities in
this connection. By 1930, the community numbered more than 1000.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>1,500 Jews were crowded into the city during the
early years of World War II. More than 80% of those who were transported
perished. Most of the Jews who returned soon moved away, and today there are
not enough Jews for a <i>minyan</i> in Liptovsky Mikulas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>In 1980, the synagogue was sold to the
municipality. After the Communist demise, in the early 1990s, public-spirited
citizens formed a committee to save the building. It received the status of a
historical monument and there was a national and international campaign to
raise funds for restoration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>On July 28, 1991, a special benefit concert was
held in the synagogue to support the restoration of historical monuments in the
city, including the synagogue. Mikulas Jews, local dignitaries and
representatives from the central Jewish community in Bratislava attended.
Gentile and Jewish volunteers spent three days cleaning the building and
removing debris. For a stage backdrop over the <i>bimah,</i> they painted on a
long drape the names and birth years of some of the 900 Mikulas Jewish victims
of the Shoah and hung it high on the Ark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>The well-attended concert was called Mosty
(Bridges), a theme that Deputy Federal Chairman Jira Dienstbier developed in
his opening address:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='font-family:Verdana'>“I do not believe
that the bridges between peoples in our country and inside us were destroyed.
The bridges are only damaged. Jewish culture is part of European culture. This
concert and the restoration of this synagogue are the beginning of something
new, something that begins with the building of bridges.”</span></p>
