in the 18th century as the Familiants Law and residence restrictions of
1726&#8211;1727 impelled many Moravian Jews to move to Slovakia, where they settled,
mostly near the western border. Jewish communities flourished and established
new centers of Jewish learning, including Hasidic enclaves in Pressburg and
Vrbov</span><span style='font-family:Verdana'>e</span><span style='font-family:

Enlightenment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

main social processes crystallized in the Jewish community in the first half of
the nineteenth century: the battle for political rights and the <i>Kulturkampf</i>
(culture conflict) that pitted Orthodox religious conservatism against a rising
trend of modernization and ritual reform. The Orthodox adherents, mainly from
Slovakia and Burgenland, had their center in Bratislava, while the chiefly
Hungarian supporters of reform drew guidance from Budapest. Communities split
into three factions: Orthodox, Neolog (Reform), and the small minority &#8220;Status
Quo Ante&#8221; faction that asserted a detachment from the schism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918 marked a new era in the life
of Slovak Jewry. <i>Kehillot</i> joined the National Federation of Czechoslovak
Jews, an organization that was vital in strengthening the scattered Jewish
communities across the republic. The first Czechoslovakian population census of
1921 counted 135,918 Slovak Jews, organized in 227 congregations, of which a
majority of 167 were Orthodox. The 29 Neolog <i>kehillot</i> decided in 1926 to
join the Status Quo Ante communities to form <i>Yeshurun,</i> the union of 60
Slovak liberal congregations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:36.0pt'>Conditions for the Jews
deteriorated rapidly after the Munich Pact in 1938 and the German occupation of
the Sudetenland that dismembered Czechoslovakia. On March 14, 1939, an
independent Slovak state was declared: a satellite of Nazi Germany; its regime
was quasi-Fascist and anti-Semitic. On the next day, Germany proclaimed a
&#8220;Protectorate&#8221; over Bohemia and Moravia, and occupied their territory.</p>

in Slovakia numbered over 130,000 in 1939. In March 1942, the Nazis began mass
deportations of Slovak Jews to the death camps in Poland. Jews were active in
the ill-fated Slovak national uprising (October 1944&#8211;March 1945). In reprisal,
more than 13,000 Jews were deported to the death camps after the uprising was
suppressed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

organization is still the Federation of Jewish Communities, whose current
difficult task is combating dangerous aspects of re-emerging anti-Semitism.

permanent part of the political, economic, and cultural history of Slovakia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
