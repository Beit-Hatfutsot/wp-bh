style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Bardejov is a major city
in the Saris region in northeastern Slovakia. It is close to the Polish border,
just south of the Topka River and a stop on the trade route between the Baltic
and Black Seas. Already a fortified town in the 14<sup>th</sup> century, it had
walls and towers protecting a settlement built around a large, rectangular
market place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Jews,
however, did not have a place in Bardejov until the mid-18<sup>th</sup>
century, since settlement in Slovak towns was forbidden to them unless they had
special permission. A Jewish presence there is first documented in 1747, when
Jews from Galicia moved in, settling northeast of the marketplace and working
as farmers in nearby villages. Growing rapidly, the Bardejov <i>kehillah</i>
and <i>hevrah kadisha</i> were established by 1806. The first synagogue, the
Altschul, was built in 1830 and in just a few years, the growth of the
community required the addition of two prayer rooms. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;

12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Sticking
to their Galician roots, the Bardejov community remained largely Hasidic. Three
of their rabbis, Moshe Leib Halberstam, Zalman Leib Halberstam, and Chaim Natan
Halberstam, were descendants of the Hasidic dynasty founded by Rabbi Chaim
Halberstam. As their community continued to expand, the Jews maintained their
traditions in custom and dress, whether at home or in public. Over the years,
the community built a Jewish civic complex near Bardejov’s historical core.
Planned according to Talmudic regulation, it came to include the synagogue, a <i>beit
midrash</i>, a mikveh, and a slaughterhouse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;

12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Jews
and Armenians were among the first to develop the hot springs close to Bardejov
as a health resort and spa. Spaciously landscaped along a narrow park, the spa
became one of the most renowned in Europe and patronized by royalty. Still
functioning, though not in Jewish hands, it caters to visitors from Israel,
among others. The well-dressed guests stroll leisurely along the shady lanes,
sipping mineral waters from specially spouted ceramic cups.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>By
1935 there were 2,264 Jews in Bardejov and the community constituted 40% of the
city’s population. A booklet written at that time by the Bardejov municipality
devoted some space to the Jews of the area. It described them as being, mostly,
shopkeepers, with a few farmers, traders and scholars. The orthodoxy of the community
was still evident, and they were said to “walk around in their long black <i>kapotes</i>
and wear traditional <i>shtraymlekh</i>, fur trimmed hats.” The author also
remarked on the importance of religious education for the Jews, and even went
on to speculate that the health of the Jewish children was imperiled because
they were cooped up for such long times, daily, in the <i>heder</i>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;

12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>When
the deportation of the Jews began in May of 1942 the <i>kehillah</i> included
2,700 people, of whom 2,400 were sent away. After the war, Bardejov became a
place for refugee rehabilitation and a center for staging “illegal” immigration
to Palestine. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

1991, Vaclav Havel, then President of Czechoslovakia, visited the Altschul
Synagogue. He declared it and the rest of the Jewish complex to be a national
monument. The buildings were to be preserved, to remember the once vital Jewish
presence they contained. Nonetheless, they are still occupied as storage and
workshops by a plumbing supply house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

one Jew still lives in Bardejov, Max Spira, who hid in the Polish forests
during the war. The last representative of his <i>kehillah</i>, he works as a <i>shohet</i>
and a <i>hazzan, </i>serving<i> </i>the few Jews of the surrounding areas.
Still meticulously Orthodox, he often conducts services all by himself in his
Bikur Holim synagogue, built in 1929. If friends should ask him with whom he
prayed so audibly on a Friday evening, he replies, “Elijah, the Prophet, was
with me.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
