<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Rhodes was
planned and built around 407 B.C.E. by Hippodamus, the foremost architect of
his time. It became the most aesthetic city in the Mediterranean basin and a
harbor for ships from the Mediterranean and Africa&#8217;s west coast. Jewish traders
settled in Rhodes as early as the second century B.C.E. Rome tolerated the Jews
scattered over the empire until Christianity spread in earnest in the third and
fourth centuries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:
Verdana'>The crusaders ruled Rhodes during the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup>
centuries. Jews lived peacefully under them, although they were confined to
their own section of the city where they built their large synagogue in the 15<sup>th</sup>
century. The Italian Jewish traveler, Meshoullam ben Menahem da Volterra
described the Rhodians&#8217; struggles in 1480. Jewish men and women participated
then in battles to repel a Turkish attack. Due to massive destruction and the
earthquakes of 1481, many Jews left the island, leaving only 22 Jewish families
in 1493. Despite their poverty, they led their lives with dignity. The <i>kehillah</i>
followed the Romaniot Greek-language tradition, the liturgy of which differs
from both Sephardic and Ashkenazic traditions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:
Verdana'>As the 16<sup>th</sup> century opened, Cardinal D&#8217;Aubusson initiated
forced conversion of the Jews to Catholocism and other persecutions. His
intended expulsions were rescinded only because he died suddenly. Soon after,
Christian pirates captured more than 2000 Jews and forced them to work on
fortifications. When the Turks, under Suleiman the Magnificent (1520-1566) besieged
the island, the Jews sided with the invader who was victorious. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:
Verdana'>The <i>kehillah</i> prospered under tolerant Ottoman rule for nearly
400 years until 1912. Suleiman had encouraged exiles from Spain to settle in
Rhodes and gave them favorable conditions, such as autonomy and religious
freedom, housing and certain tax exemptions. Jews outnumbered the Turks and
created in Rhodes a major Sephardic center that absorbed the earlier Romaniot <i>kehillah</i>
and led them to adopt Sephardic customs and Ladino. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:
Verdana'>Community life centered around the synagogue. There was the large
Romaniot synagogue, Kahal Gadol dating from 1480 and the Sephardic synagogue
Kahal Shalom built in 1577 which is the only one still standing. There were two
other smaller synagogues and several houses of study. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:
Verdana'>Reveling in the epithet &#8220;Little Jerusalem,&#8221; the <i>kehillah</i> was
well organized and the Jewish quarter hummed with Jewish life. The upper
echelons of Rhodian Jews were bankers, diplomats, doctors and international
traders. The majority of the Jews, however, remained poor and worked as
peddlers, tailors, blacksmiths and fisherman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:
Verdana'>After the Balkan wars in 1912, Rhodes and its 4500 Jews came under
Italian rule. The last great chief rabbi Reuven Eliyaahu descended from a line
of Rhodian rabbis, aimed to confer Jewish values on the younger generation. As
twentieth century ideas and contact expanded, many of the young Jews went
abroad to study and sometimes to settle in foreign lands. While some were
leaving the island, newcomers arrived during the war for Turkish independence
from allied occupation. In 1931, the new Fascist governor, Mario de Vecchi,
introduced anti-Semitic laws and closed the yeshivah. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal dir=LTR style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-indent:36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:
Verdana'>Those Jews who could afford to escape, fled to Palestine, Tangiers, or
Rhodesia. The Germans took control of the island in 1943. In 1944, the Gestapo
entered and began mass deportation without any intervention by British forces.
As the Nazis rounded up Jews, compassionate Muslim neighbors helped to hide
Judaica and Liturgical articles. The objects were returned after the war and
are now on display at the Jewish museum in Athens. Of the 1,641 Jews deported,
only 179 survived. Few retuned to the island after the war. There were 40,000
Jews in Rhodes before the war. Now, only 35 remain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
