<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:42.55pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>The Hapsburg controlled
areas of Europe, under the Catholic sovereign, Maria Theresa (1717 – 1780),
were radically intolerant of many ethnic and religious groups. The Jews were no
exception and the empress expelled <i>kehillot </i>from Prague in 1744, Buda in
1746 and Hadonin in 1774. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:42.55pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Subotica admitted Jews
to live and work in the town by permission only. Salamon Hajduska from Topolya,
Serbia was denied these privileges in 1779. Undaunted, he proceeded to Vienna
to seek an audience with the monarch, one who disdainfully conducted audiences
with Jews from behind a curtain. Fancifully surprised by Hajduska's audacity,
Maria Theresa granted him not only an audience but ordered city officials to
issue the necessary permits. She was not usually so benevolent. Her <i>malke
gelt </i>“queens money,&quot; a tax instituted in 1749, painfully drained
Jewish resources. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:42.55pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Joseph II (1741 – 1790),
Maria Theresa’s eldest child and successor, issued the <i>Toleranzpatent</i> in
1782. It abolished wearing the yellow badge and payment of the <i>malke gelt.</i>
University education, business opportunities and some civil rights were opened
to Jews, but they were required to adopt German personal and family names and
Hebrew and Yiddish communication was forbidden. As a result, Jewish education
gradually deteriorated and assimilation increased. In 1786, Jewish Subotica
consisted of 12 families who had not yet achieved the right to buy property. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:42.55pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Jewish migration from
Lower Austria, Moravia, and Galicia expanded the community and in 1802 a
synagogue in rustic Baroque style was built in the northern part of the town.
Two towers and a porch were added in an 1850 renovation but the building was
destroyed in 1913. An official census in 1807 recorded 234 Jews. As Hebrew and
Yiddish were still forbidden, Rabbi Shlomo Pulitzer, the <i>kehillah’s </i>first
rabbi, paid fines for conducting weddings in “a foreign tongue.&quot;<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:42.55pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Some of the Subotica
Jews fought with Hungary in its unsuccessful 1848 uprising against Austria.
Unfortunately, the consequence was more taxes for the Jews and destruction and
poverty in neighboring Jewish communities. To help the needy, Babette Schiffer
founded the Jewish Women’s Organization in Subotica, which celebrated 150 years
of activity in March 2002.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:42.55pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Subotica, as “Szabadka,”
passed to Hungarian jurisdiction in 1867. Jews gained full civil rights, the
community prospered and Subotica boasted Jewish professionals, academics,
manufacturers and businessmen. The turn of the century <i>kehillah, </i>numbering
3,024, urgently needed a new synagogue. Nearby Szeged held a synagogue design
contest and the Subotica <i>parnassim </i>eagerly claimed the unexecuted second
prize plan, designed by Marcell Komor and Dezso Jakab. The massive structure,
containing 1,300 seats and designed in the Secessionist style, combined Jewish
symbols, Magyar folk motifs and Oriental elements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:42.55pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Following WW I Lajos
Pollack initiated a scholarship fund for Jewish medical students and a project
to build a Jewish hospital. In 1923, the hospital was named for Rabbi Dr.
Bernat Singer who had led the new synagogue (1902 – 1916). The 1930s was a time
of prosperity for the 6000-member <i>kehillah</i>, the 4<sup>th</sup> largest
in Yugoslavia. Jewish industrialists provided many employment opportunities and
community life was full with cultural, sports and Zionist activities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:42.55pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Three quarters of the <i>kehillah</i>
perished in the <i>Shoah</i>. As postwar readjustment was so difficult, 800 of
the remaining 1200 Subotica Jews came on <i>aliyah</i> in 1948, when the State
of Israel was founded. The diminished community was incapable of maintaining
its synagogue and deeded the building to the city for cultural purposes.
Fortunately, public opposition prevented a real estate development on the site
in the 1980s. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>The World Monuments
Fund listed the Subotica synagogue as a precious, endangered cultural site in
1996, 2000 and 2002. The Jewish Heritage Grant Program of the World Monuments
Fund sponsored by the Lauder Foundation granted US$65,000 in 2000 to begin
restoring the synagogue. An international foundation “SOS Synagogue” (Save Our
Subotica Synagogue), <span style='color:green'>www.sos-sinagoga.org.yu/en/content.htm</span>),
was founded in 2001.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:42.55pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Today the community has
about 220 members, the majority born after WW ll. Steven Lanyi, studying at the
Rabbinical Seminary of the Jewish University in Budapest is the religious
leader. The <i>kehillah</i> has celebrated Jewish holiday services in the
synagogue since May 2002, and the <i>bat mitzvah</i> of three young women<i>. </i>Ten
children under the age of 12 learn in a <i>heder</i> every Sunday morning. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
