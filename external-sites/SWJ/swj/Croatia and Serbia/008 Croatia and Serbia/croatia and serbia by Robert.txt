Yugoslavia Jews played a minor, yet significant role. Not numerous in any
single community, they contributed their varied skills to the development of
trade, commerce, and culture. An important dynamic, especially in the twentieth
century, was the close contact between the Balkan Sephardic <i>kehillot </i>and
their East European Ashkenazic counterparts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Croatia during the Roman era as merchants and traders, the major waves of
immigration came after the fifteenth-century expulsions from Spain and Portugal.
The Ottoman Sultan, Bayazid II, welcomed the Sephardim whose skills,
craftsmanship, and trade connections enhanced his multi-ethnic empire.
Communities developed in Split and Dubrovnik, where the Jews enjoyed autonomy
in community matters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>The Sephardic newcomers, the
native Romaniot Jews and the Ashkenazic settlers together developed a
flourishing Jewish life. The Ashkenazim in particular, established thriving
settlements in the northern regions under Hungarian rule, in Zagreb and Osijek,
now Croatia; and in Novi Sad and Subotica, now Serbia.<span

North-Serbian autonomous province of Vojvodina in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, and economic enterprise flourished with the 1782 Tolerance Edict of
Joseph II. Newly built towns encouraged Jewish influx to help develop fledgling
industries. By the end of the nineteenth century there were nearly 40 Jewish
communities in Vojvodina, many of them Orthodox.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

reached a high degree of cooperation during World War I, when Jews and Serbs

about 76,000 Jews in Yugoslavia in 1939, only some 16,000 survived. Post-war
Croatia counted fewer than 5,000 Jews; Serbia about 4,000; Vojvodina, about
4,000; and some 3,000 in Bosnia. More than half of the Jewish survivors

safety, many of whom emigrated permanently. After the war, anti-Semitism became
somewhat dormant. Nevertheless, the Jewish future in the former Yugoslavia does
