cobble-stone town square in Polna, a town between Prague and Brno an ancient
arched passageway leads to the old ghetto complex. The ghetto has been
relatively undisturbed since the Jews were moved in, in 1681, and it had a
Jewish community until WW II. The complex, now a National Heritage Zone, but
nevertheless a proletarian neighborhood, is on a sloping meadow. There are 32
houses in an upper, triangular court and a lower, smaller, rectangular one. The
synagogue, once a dilapidated, stone building between the two courts, has been
restored as a concert and exhibition hall. A small section houses Polna&#8217;s
Judaica, formerly hoarded by the Nazis to Prague.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in Polna, then a thriving market town for the textile industry. The Jews, as

free from discrimination, humiliation and disdain.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

night guard,<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>but engaging in trade

miracles and prophecies of the Old Testament.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

visit to Polna in 1676, he established a ghetto at <i>Dolni Ulice</i><i

cemetery on the edge of town. But local landowners resented the Jewish
presence, and the area suffered from poor sanitation. The ghetto was moved in
1681 to its present location.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>In
their new environment, the Jews were permitted an autonomous municipal unit
with a Jewish judge. They could build a tannery and dig a well. The town
