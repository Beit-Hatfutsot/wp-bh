<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;tab-stops:
right 765.0pt'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Mikulov, known in German as
Nikolsburg, is a strategic castle promontory in the Pavlov hills just southeast
of Brno. It began to attract Jews in the 15<sup>th</sup> century after they
were expelled from Austria (1438) and the Moravian royal cities (1454). The
Jews were drawn to Mikulov both for its location on the trade route between
Vienna and Brno, and for the protection they found under its sovereign and his
castle's walls. They could buy and own property in Mikulov and they faced little
threat of expulsion. They were, however, often subject to the whims of the
aristocracy. As an instance of this, in 1560, the Count decreed that Jews must
give 40 days of annual service to the lords, &#8220;half on foot and half on
horseback,&#8221; ---labor with and without harness and plow. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;tab-stops:
right 765.0pt'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Despite the unfair treatment
they received, the Jews enjoyed enough stability to form a tightly organized <i>kehillah</i>,
which prospered in the local wine industry. They were able and willing to help
other Jews in distress, and when survivors of the Chmielnicki Massacres in
Poland (1648-49) made their way to Mikulov, they received a warm welcome. These
Polish Jews, in turn, brought a Hasidic influence to the religious life of the
community. Eventually the generosity of Mikulov&#8217;s Jews would be rewarded. When,
in 1719, a fire destroyed the Jewish quarter, and the community was forced to
rebuild their homes in brick, Jews from all over Europe sent donations to help
with the cost of reconstructing the quarter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;tab-stops:
right 765.0pt'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Mikulov was the primary seat
of the Moravian chief rabbinate from the 16<sup>th</sup> to the19<sup>th</sup>
centuries. Many prominent rabbis and scholars were drawn to its famous
yeshivot. The legendary Rabbi Yehudah Loew ben Bezalel officiated there (r.
1553-1573) until he left for Prague. Hasidism was encouraged in the community
by the kabbalist Rabbi Shmuel Ben Hirsch Horowitz (r. 1773-1778), and then
again by Talmudist Rabbi Mordechai ben Abraham Benet (r. 1789-1829). The last
chief rabbi from Mikulov was Rabbi Samson Rafael Hirsch (r. 1847-1851), father
of a neo-Orthodox educational system that became popular in Germany and
elsewhere. Since the mid 16<sup>th</sup> century, rabbis who passed away in
Mikulov were honored by burial in the Rabbis&#8217; Mount area of the cemetery, which
even today remains a site of pilgrimage for their followers. The cemetery
itself is one of the most important in Moravia. Its 4,000 gravestones are
archetypes of Moravian Jewish funerary art, displaying both the plant motifs of
Moravian culture along with Jewish symbols: crowns, lions and inverted scrolls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;tab-stops:
right 765.0pt'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>At first, the Jews of Mikulov
were involved mainly in the retail or wine trades, but by the 17<sup>th</sup>
century, vocations shifted towards crafts and professions. Furriers, tailors,
goldsmiths, physicians and musicians were represented in the <i>kehillah</i>.
Larger groups of tradesmen formed guilds and prayed together at their own small
synagogues. By the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, there were 12 synagogues in
the city. The Jews comprised 42 percent of the town&#8217;s population and maintained
ritual baths, hospital, yeshivah, and school for girls. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;tab-stops:
right 765.0pt'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>When the Vienna-Brno railroad
was built in 1841, the route bypassed Mikulov, which ceased to be a major
junction. As a result, many families left the overcrowded ghetto for the larger
terminal cities, where they were newly permitted to settle. As time went on,
the Jewish population dwindled and with it the number of synagogues. By 1919,
only the upper Altschul and the lower Neuschul were functioning. For the Jews
who stayed behind, however, opportunities opened up and the economic
development of the town owed a lot to them. Jewish enterprises included a
clothing mill, leather factory and a grain distribution center, among others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;tab-stops:
right 765.0pt'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>During World War I, thousands
of destitute Jews from Galicia found safety in Mikulov, but the post-war
economic decline drove most of them away. Whatever Jews were left in the city
became jeopardized by the Munich Pact of 1938 that ceded Mikulov to the Germans
as part of the Sudentenland. Whoever could, fled the city for the countryside,
enduring years of fear and deprivation. In 1941, deportation squads found 39
Mikulov Jews in hiding and promptly dispatched them to Theresienstadt. The few
Jews who returned after the war met open hostility from the gentiles who were
occupying their houses, and left. Today, there are no Jews in Mikulov.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt;tab-stops:
right 765.0pt'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>In the 1970&#8217;s, the Neuschul
synagogue was torn down by the Communist regime after years of neglect.
Alarmed, historians and researchers of the Regional Museum of Mikulov mobilized
to rescue and restore the Altschul synagogue. Expert craftsmen worked on the
synagogue painstakingly but intermittently for 12 years, as a lengthy struggle
for funds took place. Now renovated, the building serves as the town&#8217;s cultural
center. Inside, where the Ark once stood, are glass-enclosed cases for
displaying Mikulov&#8217;s Judaica, due to return from the Jewish museum in Prague.
The festive reopening of the synagogue took place on September 23, 1992, with a
concert of classical and Israeli selections performed by Jerusalem musicians.
Town residents and dignitaries joined guests from near and far and, after a
half-century hiatus, Hebrew music was heard again within those walls. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
