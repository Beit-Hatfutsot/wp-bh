picts<BR>Hi, Moshe, 
<P>Please ignore the SEQUENCE&nbsp;&nbsp; I sent in the previous note. The 
following is the correct sequence. First part is the short caption under the 
thumbnail. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>P12-16 Jewish Street. <BR>The Jewish quarter in Mikulov. Successively called 
Langegasse (Long Street), Zidovska ulice (Jews' Street), Hlavni, and Husova 
ulice, the main street slopes gently down to the fertile fields and vineyards 
that surround the town. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>N 78-12a Synagogue from castle. <BR>View from the castle terrace over the 
synagogue roof. The cemetery and its ceremonial hall are visible across town at 
the foot of Kozivrch, Goat's Hill. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>S57-6 Jewish cemetery. <BR>The Jewish cemetery in Mikulov, with legible 
stones from the beginning of the seventeenth century. The Mikulov peak shapes 
and iconographic symbols, including Moravian folk and plant motifs, and Jewish 
symbols---such as Levite pitchers and broken candles---were the archetypes for 
funereal art throughout Moravia. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>D855t (gif) Synagogue plan. <BR>Plan of the synagogue in Mikulov. A. Street 
level, showing Ark on estern wall and central <I>bimah.</I> 1. entrance, 2 and 
3. treasury, 4. <I>bimah</I> 5. Ark, 6. gallery. B. Upper level with vaulted 
L-shaped women's gallery and nine bays in central chamber. (From J. Klenovsky, 
<I>Zidovske Pamatky Mikulova, </I>1994.) <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>N78-7a Synagogue facades. <BR>The Altschul on Husova ulice in Mikulov, 1550; 
major restorations: 1719-1723 and 1977-1993. In 1561 the corner nearest the 
street was accented by the construction of a one-cloumn loggia. Such a miniature 
open area on the ground floor was a fashionable architectural element of the 
period. The Altschul is one of the two surviving synagogues in Mikulov and the 
only one that has been restored. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>N75-29 Columns of the central <I>bimah,</I> with Corinthian capitals, and the 
stucco-decorated nine-bay ceiling, dating from the synagogue renovation of 1723. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<P>B39-39a Synagogue interior. <BR>Prewar photo of the synagogue interior. The 
Ark is draped in an elaborate stucco baldachin topped by a crown. Baroque iron 
grille work embellishes the Ark and enhances the tall windows. The narrow 
<I>bimah</I> is positioned under a four-columned canopy in the center of the 
prayer hall. Rich stucco ornamentation covers arches and vaults. Inscription in 
the cartouche reads: <I>:Lishmoa l'Shadai melekh elyon" </I>("To harken unto the 
Lord, supreme King"). (Courtesy of Regionalni Muzeum, Mikulov.) <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>D58 Rededication concert. <BR>Synagogue reopening, September 23, 1992. 
Galleries and sanctuary were filled with guests at the festive concert by 
visiting Israeli performers. (Photo provided by Wendy Eisler-Kashy.) <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>S6-27 Passover plate. <BR>Repousse silver passover plate from Moravia, 
depictiing the Exodus from Egypt. The multitudes are passing through a gate on 
the right, which recalls the structure of the old city gate of Mikulov. Dating 
from the mid-nineteenth century, it measures 13 1/2 by 10 inches. (Courtesy of 
Jewish Museum of Prague; inv. no. 3940.) </P></BODY></HTML>
