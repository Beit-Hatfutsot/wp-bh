style='font-family:Verdana'>Mikulov, known in German as Nikolsburg, is a
strategic castle promontory in the Pavlov hills just southeast of Brno. It
began to attract Jews in the 15<sup>th</sup> century after they were expelled
from Austria (1438) and the Moravian royal cities (1454). The Jews were drawn
to Mikulov both for its location on the trade route between Vienna and Brno,
and for the protection they found under its sovereign and his castle's walls. They
could buy and own property in Mikulov and they faced little threat of
expulsion. They were, however, often subject to the whims of the aristocracy.
As an instance of this, in 1560, the Count decreed that Jews must give 40 days
of annual service to the lords, &#8220;half on foot and half on horseback,&#8221; &#8212;labor
with and without harness and plow. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:102.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>Despite the unfair treatment they received, the
Jews enjoyed enough stability to form a tightly organized <i>kehillah</i> which
prospered in the local wine industry. They were able and willing to help other Jews
in distress, and when survivors of the Chmielnicki Massacres in Poland
(1648-49) made their way to Mikulov, they received a warm welcome. These Polish
Jews, in turn, brought a Hasidic influence to the religious life of the
community. Eventually the generosity of Mikulov&#8217;s Jews would be rewarded. When,
in 1719, a fire destroyed the Jewish quarter, and the community was forced to
rebuild their homes in brick, Jews from all over Europe sent donations to help
with the cost of reconstructing the quarter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:102.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>Mikulov was the primary seat of the Moravian chief
rabbinate from the 16<sup>th</sup> to the19<sup>th</sup> centuries. Many
prominent rabbis and scholars were drawn to its famous yeshivot. The legendary
Rabbi Yehudah Loew ben Bezalel officiated there (r. 1553-1573) until he left for
Prague. Hasidism was encouraged in the community by the kabbalist Rabbi Shmuel
Ben Hirsch Horowitz (r. 1773-1778), and then again by talmudist Rabbi Mordechai
ben Abraham Benet (r. 1789-1829). The last chief rabbi from Mikulov was Rabbi
Samson Rafael Hirsch (r. 1847-1851), father of a neo-Orthodox educational
system that became popular in Germany and elsewhere. Since the mid 16<sup>th</sup>
century, rabbis who passed away in Mikulov were honored by burial in the
Rabbis&#8217; Mount area of the cemetery, which even today remains a site of
pilgrimage for their followers. The cemetery itself is one of the most
important in Moravia. Its 4,000 gravestones are archetypes of Moravian Jewish
funerary art, displaying both the plant motifs of Moravian culture along with
Jewish symbols: crowns, lions and inverted scrolls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:102.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>At first, the Jews of Mikulov were involved mainly
in the retail or wine trades, but by the 17<sup>th</sup> century, vocations
shifted towards crafts and professions. Furriers, tailors, goldsmiths,
physicians and musicians were represented in the <i>kehillah</i>. Larger groups
of tradesmen formed guilds and prayed together at their own small synagogues.
By the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, there were 12 synagogues in the city. The
Jews comprised 42 percent of the town&#8217;s population and maintained ritual baths,
hospital, yeshivah, and school for girls. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:102.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>When the Vienna-Brno railroad was built in 1841, the
route bypassed Mikulov, which ceased to be a major junction. As a result, many
families left the overcrowded ghetto for the larger terminal cities, where they
were newly permitted to settle. As time went on, the Jewish population dwindled
and with it the number of synagogues. By 1919, only the upper Altschul and the lower
Neuschul were functioning. For the Jews who stayed behind, however,
opportunities opened up and the economic development of the town owed a lot to
them. Jewish enterprises included a clothing mill, leather factory and a grain
distribution center, among others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:Verdana'>During World War I, thousands of destitute Jews
from Galicia found safety in Mikulov, but the post-war economic decline drove
most of them away. Whatever Jews were left in the city became jeopardized by
the Munich Pact of 1938 that ceded Mikulov to the Germans as part of the
Sudentenland. Whoever could, fled the city for the countryside, enduring years
of fear and deprivation. In 1941, deportation squads found 39 Mikulov Jews in
hiding and promptly dispatched them to Theresienstadt. The few Jews who
returned after the war met open hostility from the gentiles who were occupying
their houses, and left. Today, there are no Jews in Mikulov.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:Verdana'>In the 1970&#8217;s, the Neuschul synagogue was torn down
by the Communist regime after years of neglect. Alarmed, historians and
researchers of the Regional Museum of Mikulov mobilized to rescue and restore
the Altschul synagogue. Expert craftsmen worked on the synagogue painstakingly
but intermittently for 12 years, as a lengthy struggle for funds took place.
Now renovated, the building serves as the town&#8217;s cultural center. Inside, where
the Ark once stood, are glass-enclosed cases for displaying Mikulov&#8217;s Judaica,
due to return from the Jewish museum in Prague. The festive reopening of the
synagogue took place on September 23, 1992, with a concert of classical and
Israeli selections performed by Jerusalem musicians. Town residents and dignitaries
joined guests from near and far and, after a half-century gap, Hebrew music was
heard again within those walls. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
