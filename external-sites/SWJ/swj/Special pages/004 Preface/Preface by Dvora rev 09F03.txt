unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>A course on Renaissance
Art at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and a lecture by architect David
Cassuto on synagogues in Italy motivated a trip to Italy. Our first stop was at
the antiquities of Rome&#8217;s ancient port, Ostia, where a 4<sup>th</sup> century
synagogue was identified in 1962, at a distance from the main excavated area.
It was so undeveloped and neglected that museum officials could not help us
find it. But, pointed in the right direction by a passer-by, we went a long way
until we discerned the stone columns of the synagogue. The reward lay in seeing
the synagogue with its ancient mosaic floor and fallen architrave, engraved
with Jewish symbols.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;text-indent:36.0pt;direction:ltr;
unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>We saw a silent,
unattended synagogue in Urbino and well-preserved synagogues in Ferrara,
Verona, Parma, Soragna and Mantua. In Sabbioneta, a third-floor synagogue with
tall, bronze candelabra, is bereft of Jews since the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century. After we saw these little known synagogues, documenting synagogue art
and architecture became a project and a passion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Our five seasons of field
work took us to 350 synagogues in eight countries, then another seven years of
research and writing. From local people, especially among the older ones, there
was a readiness to tell us at length about their former Jewish neighbors. One
municipal worker consoled us when he saw our horror at the shambles of his
town&#8217;s synagogue, <i>&#8220;Aber wir haben einen sh”nen Friedhof.&#8221; </i>(But we have a
beautiful cemetery.&#8221;).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The capitals &#8211; Budapest,
Bratislava, Prague, Vienna, Rome, Athens, Zagreb, Belgrade &#8211; still have small,
but viable Jewish communities, and their major synagogues are documented. It is
in the hinterland where they must be documented and perhaps recovered from
neglect, adaptation to mundane use, or destruction, before all traces of Jewish
presence vanish.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>We were excited by the
good will and cooperation of many officials and lay people. They helped us make
contacts, to enter synagogue buildings and copy documents. They often went out
of their way to find people who could share with us their memories of life with
Jewish neighbors prior to WWII. A few put us off or were hostile. One woman, in
a tiny, former village synagogue, read our letter of introduction and slammed
the door in our faces, <i>&#8220;Wir haben das Haus gekauft!&#8221;</i> (We bought this
house!). But many friends are still in contact with us, updating us on
restorations and other events. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>There were non-Jews who
proudly showed us evidence of their family&#8217;s Jewish past and there were some
who gave us a bed and breakfast since there were few hotels or &#8220;zimmer&#8221;
(pensions) in some of the out-of-the-way places. We met synagogue caretakers,
such as Imre Pogone in Mad, Hungary, where there are no Jews. In Perugia,
Italy, all hotels served a cosmeticians convention, so the head of the small
Jewish community, Sergio Pacifici, observed an old Jewish custom and put us up <i>in</i>
the synagogue &#8211; an apartment in the old Jewish Quarter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Our project brought us
into contact with the last or almost last Jew in many towns&#8212;Holocaust
survivors, clinging to vestiges of identity in a rapidly diminishing Jewish
reality. Our guide in Hlohovec, Slovakia, was a scholarly, observant Jew, Moshe
Gluck, fluent in Hebrew, who lived his last year in Israel. He never rode over
the bridge in his town for the approach of which the town had destroyed the
community&#8217;s synagogue. Whenever he needed to cross it, Moshe walked the whole
way over and stopped briefly to say a memorial prayer. Other survivors showed
us community mementos or told us personal histories.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

few foreign visitors, so we repeatedly heard a ubiquitous question, &#8220;Was your
family from this town?&#8221; In our wide-ranging and intensive effort on the Jewish

&#8220;Yes,&#8221; we replied, &#8220;our family came from this town.&#8221;</span><span
