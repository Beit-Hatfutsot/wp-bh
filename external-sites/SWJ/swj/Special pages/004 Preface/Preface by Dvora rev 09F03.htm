<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>A
course on Renaissance Art at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem and a lecture by
architect David Cassuto on synagogues in Italy motivated a trip to Italy. Our
first stop was at the antiquities of Rome&#8217;s ancient port, Ostia, where a 4<sup>th</sup>
century synagogue was identified in 1962, at a distance from the main excavated
area. It was so undeveloped and neglected that museum officials could not help
us find it. But, pointed in the right direction by a passer-by, we went a long
way until we discerned the stone columns of the synagogue. The reward lay in
seeing the synagogue with its ancient mosaic floor and fallen architrave,
engraved with Jewish symbols.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>We
saw a silent, unattended synagogue in Urbino and well-preserved synagogues in
Ferrara, Verona, Parma, Soragna and Mantua. In Sabbioneta, a third-floor
synagogue with tall, bronze candelabra is bereft of Jews since the beginning of
the 20<sup>th</sup> century. After we saw these little known synagogues,
documenting synagogue art and architecture became a project and a passion. Here
was a story that had to be told. Our five seasons of fieldwork took us to 340
synagogues in eight countries. Then followed another seven years of research
and writing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The
capitals---Budapest, Bratislava, Prague, Vienna, Rome, Athens, Zagreb,
Belgrade---still have small, but viable Jewish communities, and their major
synagogues are known and published. It is in the hinterland where they must be
documented and perhaps recovered from neglect, adaptation to mundane use, or
destruction, before all traces of Jewish presence vanish. From local people,
especially among the older ones, there was a readiness to tell us at length
about their former Jewish neighbors. One municipal official consoled us when he
saw our horror at the shambles of his town&#8217;s synagogue, <i>&#8220;Aber wir haben
einen sh”nen Friedhof.&#8221; </i>(But we have a beautiful cemetery.&#8221;).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>We
were excited by the good will and cooperation of many officials and lay people.
They helped us make contacts, to enter synagogue buildings and copy documents.
They often went out of their way to find people who could share with us
memories of life with Jewish neighbors before WWII. Very few put us off or were
hostile. One woman, in a tiny, former village synagogue, read our letter of
introduction and slammed the door in our faces, <i>&#8220;Wir haben das Haus
gekauft!&#8221;</i> (&#8220;We bought this house!&#8221;). But many friends are still in contact
with us, updating us on restorations and other events. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Since
there were few hotels or &#8220;zimmer&#8221; (pensions) in some of the out-of-the-way places,
there were those who invited us to bed and breakfast. We met synagogue
caretakers, such as Imre Pogone in Mad, Hungary, where there are no Jews. In
Perugia, Italy, all hotels served a cosmeticians&#8217; convention, so the head of
the small Jewish community, Sergio Pacifici, observed an old Jewish custom and
put us up <i>in</i> the synagogue: an apartment in the old Jewish Quarter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>There
were non-Jews who proudly showed us evidence of their family&#8217;s Jewish past. The
project brought us into contact with the last or almost last Jew in many
towns---Holocaust survivors, clinging to vestiges of identity in a rapidly
diminishing Jewish reality. Our guide in Hlohovec, Slovakia, was a scholarly,
observant Jew, Moshe Gluck, fluent in Hebrew, who lived his last year in Israel.
He never rode over the bridge in his town for the approach of which the town
had destroyed the community&#8217;s synagogue. Whenever he needed to cross it, Moshe
walked the whole way over and stopped briefly to recite the Psalms. Other
survivors showed us community mementos or told us personal histories.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
36.0pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed'><span style='font-family:Verdana'>These
villages attract few foreign visitors, so we were often asked the ubiquitous
question, &#8220;Was your family from this town?&#8221; In our wide-ranging and intensive
effort on the Jewish built heritage, we felt that we were intrinsic to the
local Jewish past. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; we replied, &#8220;our family came from this town.&#8221;</span><span
