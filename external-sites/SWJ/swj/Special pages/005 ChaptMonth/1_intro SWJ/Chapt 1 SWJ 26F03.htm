there might be a tendency to report catastrophes rather than the everyday
achievements of community life. Indeed, the ordinary tribulations of living
pale before the onslaught of marauding armies that pillage their way recklessly
through a terrorized populace. A house built with love, pain, and treasure can
collapse in an hour's conflagration. Valuables accumulated over a lifetime can
be swept away in a sudden flood. But despite the disasters they faced, Jews
persevered. They built homes, synagogues, schools and businesses. They married,
begat children, and transmitted the living tradition of a culture infused with
moral values. Less dramatic perhaps than catastrophes, these events are the
real essence of their history. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

synagogues we saw in the countries of central and southern Europe and the
histories of the <i>kehillot</i> (the Jewish communities) who built and used
them. We vacillated endlessly over which synagogues to include: What should
influence our decision? Should we apply criteria of art and architectural
quality, the historical importance of the <i>kehillah</i>, antiquity or our
personal preferences? The relatively well-known synagogues of the capitals did
not need our coverage, but a few of the larger non-capital cities did, such as
Trieste, Graz, and Pilsen. These cities are included in our book because they
are mostly unfrequented by Jewish travelers and because their stories are
relevant for historical balance. Ultimately we chose a representative set
(barely a tenth of those we saw and documented), a set that touched on our
several criteria. In retrospect, we probably skimped on outright ruins despite
our earlier intentions to include more of them. Along with the lights and
shadows of personal and community lives, there are descriptions of events
(provided by our local history/sources) that illuminate the general character
of the Jewish experience in Europe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

geographical area corresponding roughly, to what was once the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, but does so in terms of the present political divisions. Jewish history
in Europe, that of a national and religious minority, has had a generic
similarity throughout that region over the two-millennium rise and fall of
Jewish settlement. Yet the factors that operated in each country to influence
the relations between the Jews and the rulers or the majority population, have
varied. An indication of such similarities and differences can be found in our
brief Jewish history for each country that precedes the chapters on that
country's respective communities. Here you will also find some information
about completed synagogue restorations; recent and ongoing or planned synagogue
restorations are listed in the appendix.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:Verdana'>and protection of local or sovereign rulers.
Locating their settlement near a palace or castle was a commonplace practice,
but Jews could be expelled from a town or a region at the whim of a monarch or
of the intolerant crowd he obeyed. Between major misfortunes, Jews made out as
best they could under occupational restrictions and outward behavior that was
antagonistically dictated to them by a hostile Church and the popular majority
it controlled. The large royal cities where the Jews made their livelihood in
trade were often forbidden to Jewish settlement, so the Jews lived in myriad
towns and villages within commuting distance. <i>Kehillah</i> size could be
small, with the synagogue in proportion: In Rad</span><span style='font-family:
Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>nice, Bohemia, for example, the late
eighteenth century synagogue building, which functioned for a long time as a
garage before recent restoration, accommodated exactly one vehicle. Sustained
by manual arts, trade, or money-lending, Jews actively pursued a life of
learning and intellectual profession, often emphasizing but not limited to
narrow religious confines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One wonders where the Jews got
their tenacity&#8212;to be rebuffed again and again in the struggle for sheer
survival; to have to ask for permission and to pay in coin for every breath of
life; to be banished from home on short notice and then to return to the same
desperate exertions on the merest invitation. They must have been nourished by
a zest for life, an optimism born of faith in a tradition that held that the
highest good was life itself---and the hope for a future destined to be better
than the present. Mutual self-help, from family to <i>kehillah</i> to the
greater community of Israel, was an intrinsic part of that tradition. The
verse, <i>&quot;Kol Yisrael arevin zeh bazeh&quot;</i> (&quot;All of Israel are
responsible one for the other&quot;; Shavuot 39) found and still finds its
expression in communal institutions devoted to welfare and the improvement of
the community and the individual. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>The mainstay of communal
life was the synagogue, the centrality of which as a place of congregation and
prayer developed rapidly in the Diaspora as it did in Eretz Yisrael (the Land
of Israel) after the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans in 70 C.E.
The synagogue served as a temple substitute, a hallmark of Jewish community for
the next two millennia. Over the centuries, the synagogues were the places most
fully charged with specific Jewish identity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>The synagogues we
documented are the repository of what was artistically important to the
communities that built and used them. Practicing <i>hiddur mitzvah</i>
(enhancing the commandment), European Jewish communities strove to beautify
their synagogues. Exteriors were plain (whether by law or for self-protection)
until the mid-nineteenth-century Emancipation, but the interiors were rich with
color and embellished with the finest materials each <i>kehillah</i> could
afford. Primary artistic emphasis went to the Aron Kodesh (the Holy Ark in
which the Torah scrolls were housed), which were crafted from wood, with
distinctive doors, guardian pillars and gilded highlights. Ceilings were often
blue and emblazoned with random stars of gold around focal stucco forms and
symbols. In some regions floral and animal motifs decorated panels of prayers
inscribed on the walls. Post-Emancipation synagogues extended the symbolic and
decorative elements to the exterior as well, in architectural styles suited to
the times. Even in their present condition, synagogues in Europe are the most
significant clue to the public aesthetics of Jewish life there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

once-ubiquitous Jewish presence in central and southern Europe, two generations
after the Shoah (Holocaust)? In the cities, towns, and villages across the
continent, overgrown cemeteries and synagogues that still stand may be the sole
reminders of an enterprising Jewish existence that once extended to every
hamlet. As we researched, we were literally racing against time, against
indifference, deterioration and demolition. In tiny Pecovska Nova Ves,
Slovakia, a decrepit synagogue is used as a barn today. The present owners
refused us access, and we could document only the exterior and the local
cemetery. In Vseruby, Bohemia, we were too late; town officials informed us
that they had torn down the synagogue eleven months earlier because engineers
had declared the building unsafe. That story was repeated in Podolinec,
Slovakia, where officials gave us photos, the facade of the no-longer-existent
synagogue. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>Left ownerless after the
Jews were deported, property was quickly seized by neighbors. Factories and
workshops were reorganized under ad hoc non-Jewish management that devolved
into ownership. Community buildings, such as rabbis' residences or easily
convertible village synagogues, were snapped up for living quarters. Viewing
the derelict synagogue buildings merely as available space, postwar authorities
adapted most of them to practical use as storerooms or workshops, many for
dwellings, some for churches, and a few for cultural or administrative purposes
such as libraries, museums, or archives. In only a few instances, the buildings
were given back to the fledgling postwar Jewish communities, but these
communities were always too small to use more than the <i>beit midrash</i>
(study room) for prayers, and too indigent to maintain the buildings properly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

deliberate destruction of synagogues on <i>Kristalnacht,</i> November 9 and 10,
1938, and kept it up through World War II. The destruction continued even after
the war. At Humenne and at Michalovce in Slovakia, synagogues in good condition
were demolished for being &quot;too close&quot; to newly raised Communist Party
headquarters. Under communism in Hungary, an elegant 1914 synagogue in Mako by
architect Lipot Baumhorn was deliberately torn down. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

synagogues that still stand may worsen as democracy strengthens its foothold in
central Europe. The present dynamics of social change are accompanied by
political unrest and outbursts of national patriotism, too often with an
anti-Semitic bent. Towns and cities are undergoing rapid physical alterations
under the vagaries of economic conditions. The old synagogues are in the midst
of this turmoil because they were commonly built on choice locations on or near
town centers. Previously only moderately safe under stagnant regimes, the new
political dynamism subjects them to the possibility of accelerated attrition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

preoccupied with problems of daily living to be concerned about the restoration
of synagogues that are miles away in towns that no longer have Jews. During our
research in the early 1990s, Jewish officials in the urban centers of
Bratislava, Prague, and Budapest had little accurate information on the state
of synagogue buildings located far from the capitals. Ironically, it was a
report of our findings that helped community officials in Bratislava, then
preparing restitution claims, to assess the extent and disposition of
synagogues still standing. Our report went also to the Jewish Heritage Council
of the World Monuments Fund and was instrumental a few years later when the
Council conducted an extensive survey of the Jewish built heritage in the Czech
Republic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The hundreds of synagogues that
still stand all across Europe---deserted or used for menial purposes---raise
the question of what to do with them. As we traveled from town to town and saw
synagogues in various states of disuse or decay, we thought about the religious
significance of such desecration. Certain talmudic passages (Megillah, 26a-b,
27a-b) evaluate the sanctity of the synagogue. The buildings are sacred when
they contain at least one Torah scroll in an Aron Kodesh, but both the Aron
Kodesh and the synagogue lose many degrees of sanctity if the Torah is missing.
However, a defiled Holy Ark or an empty synagogue is still precious because the
residual sanctity derives from the activities that belonged to them. When no
longer in Jewish use, &quot;the synagogue building may not be sold for any
unclean purpose such as a bath, a tannery, a laundry, or even for a mikveh
(ritual bath).&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>The Holy Ark is holier
than the synagogue. Remains of an Ark that has fallen into disuse must be
preserved as carefully as damaged Torah scrolls. Ruins of a synagogue may be
used for certain secular purposes only, because the building retains some of
its sanctity. Ideally, a ruin should be left untouched, with weeds growing
around it to arouse compassion in the viewer. &quot;For the country shall be
all thorn bushes and thistles&quot; (Isa. 7:24). &quot;I will lay your cities
in ruin, and make your sanctuaries desolate&quot; (Lev. 26:31).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mundane use. In our view, every synagogue and cemetery still standing in
central Europe is the landmark of a former Jewish presence. We believe that
wherever feasible, these synagogues should remain. Let them stand as monuments
across the continent of Europe, each a witness to a <i>kehillah</i> that was

general cultural use. Restoration for public enrichment where there are few or

purposes and the inclusion of a Jewish museum area can enhance rather than
disturb a former synagogue's new function. The well-renovated buildings in
Apostag, Hungary; Holesov, Moravia; and Gorizia, Italy, are fine examples of
Jewish art and architecture. Serving now as cultural centers, they also recall
past community achievement and status.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Unfortunately, not all
restorations were so sensitively executed in the past. The sparkling
neo-Moresque exterior of the synagogue in Kecskemet, Hungary, is authentic, but
no sign remains of the original magnificent interior. The Functionalist 1934
synagogue in Zilina, one of the most beautiful in Czechoslovakia, was drastically
modified. It now serves as a technical school auditorium, and all indications
of its Jewish origin have been abolished. Many current synagogue restoration
projects show greater concern for the building's essential character.
Responsible officials are careful to affix a plaque acknowledging the building
as a former synagogue and commemorating the Jews who died in the Shoah. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Selecting candidate buildings for
restoration involves architectural and artistic evaluation of a building's
importance as well as the availability of funding. Since all former synagogues
cannot be rehabilitated, it is important that at least the significant
synagogue buildings in towns without Jews should be preserved. A national
committee, including architects, historians, and representatives of the Jewish
community, should determine the criteria for selecting which buildings will be
restored. Even in buildings where restoration costs are high and work schedules
drag on for years---as in Mikulov and Trebic, Moravia, or St. Polten, Austria
and Novi Sad, Croatia---the final results justify all the efforts. Other
synagogues for which extensive restoration is not possible should at least be
minimally renovated, clearly marked as former synagogues, and used for some
respectable public purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

have often turned to Jewish sources for support. Sometimes former residents
responded to the nostalgic appeal with generous contributions and were pivotal
in the success of the venture---as in Slavkov (formerly, Austerlitz), Moravia,
and other places. In our view, however, the Jewish charity agenda, for all its
nebulous breadth, has goals enough without adding on the respon</span><span
style='font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>sibility of financing
cultural shrines for towns that are judenrein (without Jews). Fundraising
should be a local or national obligation. The people of Apostag, for instance,
have set an example for excellent restoration achievement with minimal funds.
There is hope, too, that international agencies concerned with the preservation
of national monuments will succeed in aiding some localities to rescue and
restore extant remnants of the Jewish built heritage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Synagogue restoration in historic
Jewish locations has shown itself to be a wise investment. The international
crowds that swarm the Jewish quarter in Prague, the Dohany synagogue in
Budapest and the Ghetto Nuovo in Venice are vivid proof that tourism to Jewish
sites is big business. (These lands are also destinations for Jews searching
for their roots.) With the Cold War over and the tide of Western tourism
swelling to central Europe, municipalities have begun to recognize the tourist
potential of Jewish sites and many have organized some preservation or
restoration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

theme, their inherent association with the synagogue impels us to include them
in the context of the changes affecting the synagogues of Europe. Furniture and
ceremonial objects for the synagogue received the same attention to artistic
quality as synagogue design. Candelabra, once the primary evening light source
and often enhanced with reflectors (as in Mondovi, Italy) and lamps in
unlimited variety, illuminated and decorated the synagogue space. Craftsmen
devised ritual objects of precious materials: silver Torah crowns, Torah
shields, rimmonim (finials), or brocade parokhot (Ark curtains). People marked
major personal events with gifts of such articles for the synagogue. Parents
celebrated a son's first visit to the synagogue with the gift of a wimple---an
embroidered linen Torah binder. Wealthy Jews may have commissioned artistic
ceremonial objects such as illuminated Megillot (scrolls of the Book of
Esther), </span><span style='font-family:Verdana;mso-fareast-language:EN-US'>porcelain

synagogues in the Shoah, except for the distinction that the Judaica was
portable. Some of it was, therefore, saved in hidden places and returned, as in
Ioannina, Greece. But portability meant that anyone could take it without
having to answer for it&#8212;and untold numbers of stolen Jewish artifacts from
synagogues and Jewish homes still enrich houses, shops, and museums throughout
Europe. An exception of sorts took place in Czechoslovakia, where the Germans
plundered the artifacts systematically and shipped them to the State Jewish
Museum in Prague. There they were carefully catalogued by Jewish experts under
coercion and stored in any available space for the Nazis' intended museum of
&quot;decadent Jewish art.&quot; A sizable synagogue building is still used to
hoard just a portion of the stolen parokhot. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of this Judaica concentration was the Torah Scroll Project, described in our
chapter on Kojetin, in which Torah scrolls were rescued, repaired and
distributed to active <i>kehillot</i> worldwide. The State Jewish Museum, now
the Jewish Museum, in possession of the Czech Jewish community in Prague since
1994, has considered returning individual artifacts to their places of origin
wherever suitable Jewish museums are established. Returning Judaica items to
small local museums in restored synagogues is historically justified, but risky
because of the danger of theft. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

illustrate that host countries claim the art in their domain as their cultural
heritage. One might expect countries that are finding plundered Judaica within
their borders to offer it gratis to Jewish institutions for distribution and
use in living Jewish congregations anywhere. At the least, there should be a
readiness to negotiate with Jewish art experts and historians to produce a
feasible plan for the transferral of a reasonable proportion of these Judaic
treasures to Israel and Jewish communities worldwide.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
