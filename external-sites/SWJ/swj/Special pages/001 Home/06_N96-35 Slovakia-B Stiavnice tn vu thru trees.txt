style='font-family:Verdana'>The medieval mining town of Banska Stiavnice lies
in the heart of the forested Kremnice Mountains of central Slovakia. A dirt
road below the three towering pine trees leads to the old Jewish cemetery and
the crumbling ruins of its ceremonial hall. The 1893 synagogue building at the
foot of the hill served in 1991 as a meeting place for the town’s automobile
club.</span><span style='mso-fareast-language:EN-US'><o:p></o:p></span></p>
