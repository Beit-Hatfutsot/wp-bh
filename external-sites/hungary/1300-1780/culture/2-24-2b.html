	                    The first Jewish physician in Hungary, Oesterreicher was born in &Oacute;buda and took his 
						medical oath in 1782 at the University of Buda. He specialized in mineral waters; in 
						Balatonf&uuml;red he founded a hospital that later become famous.<br><br> 
						“The Royal University of Buda has received special instructions from His Majesty that 
						the freedom of physicians, in other words, the doctorate of  
			            physicians be conferred on non-Catholics in the same manner as on Catholics. Now, on the twenty-first day of the
						month before Lent this honor has been conferred on J&oacute;zsef Manes Oesterreicher  
						of the Jewish nation and faith. There can be no doubt that this new order will promote the 
						welfare of the University. The above named physician doctor, who has recently authored an 
						elaborate and fine study on the medicinal waters of Buda and other regions, is from Buda by 
						birth and will herewith become the official physician of the bitter waters of F&uuml;red.”<br> 
					    (18th letter of <i>Magyar H&iacute;rmond&oacute;</i>, dated “second day of Lent” of the year 1782)
