                        After the laws restricting Jewish settlement and activities, 
						King B&eacute;la IV’s Charter of Privileges established the 
						private legal status of Jews, and guaranteed their personal security 
	    				and their practice of religion. The Jews living in the country became 
						the servants of the Royal Chamber (the Treasury); the office of 
						“Judge of the Jews” (<i>Judex Judaeorum</i>), held by a Christian   
						judge nominated by the king, was instituted. The “Judge of the Jews” dealt
	                    with affairs of Jewish property taxes, representation in the government and protection of rights.
	                    The Jews repeatedly asked for the confirmation of the charter, 
						which they were granted by succeeding rulers.
