					  Around 1477 King Matthias I (Corvinus) established the institution 
					  of the “Jewish Prefecture”  (<i>Prefectus Judaeorum</i>). The prefect was 
					  a Jew, and he was the secular leader of the community who had a title 
					  in the court as a result of his position. The office of the Jewish principal 
					  was held by the Mendel family of Buda, who were also known as “Jewish Princes” (<i>Princeps Judaeorum</i>).<br>
					  <BR>According to contemporary descriptions, the wedding celebrations of King 
					  Matthias and Queen Beatrix were attended by a delegation of some one hundred 
					  splendidly dressed Jews carrying Torah scrolls and a flag, who came to 
					  present their gifts to the royal couple. They covered their heads with <i>tallits</i>, 
					  recited prayers and sang hymns. All the costs of one day of the royal wedding 
					  ceremonies – which lasted several weeks – were financed by the Jews of Buda.
