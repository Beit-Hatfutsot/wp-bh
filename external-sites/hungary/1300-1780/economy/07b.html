         					   In the early 1500s, Shelomo ben Efraim (Shelomo Seneor) (1526- ?) was treasurer to King 
        					   Lajos II (1516–1526). Perhaps because he was ambitious or perhaps due to a love affair 
        					   with a Christian woman, he converted to Christianity. He received his Hungarian name,  
        					   Imre Szerencs&eacute;s (Fortunatus) from his godfather, the palatine. He was severely criticized many times 
        				       because of his political and economic influence.
        	                   He was even imprisoned for a
        	                   while. The mob rushed at his house, the riot spread over to the Jewish Street, and resulted in a pogrom. 
        					   At the end of his life he stood in the king’s favour again. He gave large sums of money to
        					   equip the army that was to fight against the Turkish invaders. He never ceased to write his 
        					   personal notes in Hebrew, and even after he converted he practiced charity among the Jews.
