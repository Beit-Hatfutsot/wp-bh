										For many years this inner town cafe was the editorial “office” of <i>A H&eacute;t</i> 
										(<i>The Week</i>), the periodical edited by J&oacute;zsef Kiss. The printing house 
										of the periodical was opposite the cafe.
										<br>“Every Friday and Saturday different corners of the cafe were occupied 
										by some gentlemen of shifty appearance who hardly ever turned up on weekdays. 
										They could sit for hours drinking a small glass of beer and busily scribbling 
										lines after lines on sheets of the same size. These were the collaborators of <i>A H&eacute;t</i>
										. Swarming crowd, murmur, the swirl of discussions flying here and there, the thick 
										smoke could not disturb them. […] Here, in the middle of waving, living life […] was <i>A H&eacute;t</i> 
										 written.”  
										(J&oacute;zsef Kiss, 1899)
