									“Josua Stampfer, son of the Szombathely <i>dayan</i>, made his way on 
									foot from Budapest to Jerusalem through the Balkans, Turkey, Anatolia and 
									Syria, wandering for months in the desert without food or drink 
									until he reached his destination. […] He was an extremely pious man and governed 
									the colony in a religious spirit. Still, he was the one who 
									had once given orders to violate the Sabbath in the synagogue. Once, during the Sabbath 
									prayers, he received news that Bedouins had attacked the colony. Stampfer stopped his 
									recital of the <i>Shmone Esre</i>, threw off his <i>tallit</i> and ordered the men to interrupt 
									their prayers and grab their guns.”
									(J&oacute;zsef Patai, <i>A f&ouml;lt&aacute;mad&oacute; Szentf&ouml;ld</i> [<i>The Holy Land 
									Rising Again</i>] Vienna, 1926)
