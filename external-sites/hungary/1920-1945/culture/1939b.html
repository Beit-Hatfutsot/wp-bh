										As a consequence of the First and Second Jewish Laws, Jewish actors lost 
										their work. The theatrical and opera performances held in Goldmark Hall gave

										“We were deprived of our intellectual work and physical livelihood at the 
										same time. We may have survived the latter, but we choked on the word, 
										which we were forbidden to utter. Work at Goldmark Hall was financially 
										completely insignificant, but this was our pulpit. It is to my satisfaction 
										that we did not use this pulpit for cheap, inferior purposes.”
